I did the following two modifications to make Ansible playbook I got from galaxy admin training respository, work on my end. In the original versions parameters are defined based on the parameters defined in just the previous line. 

1-In the file roles/galaxyproject.galaxy/vars/layout-root-dir.yml:
__galaxy_mutable_config_dir: "{{ galaxy_root }}/var/config"
__galaxy_shed_tools_dir: "{{ galaxy_root }}/var/shed_tools"
__galaxy_tool_dependency_dir: "{{ galaxy_root }}/var/dependencies"

In the original versions parameters are defined based on the parameters defined in just the previous line. My Ansible could not intrepret that.

2-In the file roles/galaxyproject.galaxy/tasks/virtualenv.yml
virtualenv_command: pyvenv
comment out "virtualenv_python:" variable

without those two changes the virtualenv was built based on python2 and some new python script which was written based on python3 was not readable. This change also suggested in 
suggested in roles/galaxyproject.galaxy/READEME.md for Galaxy >=20.01
